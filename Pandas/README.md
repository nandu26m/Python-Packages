# 🛍️ Sales Data Analysis Project

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Merged all monthly CSVs** into a single DataFrame.
2. **Dropped NaN rows** and handled bad headers.
3. Converted data types for:
   - `Quantity Ordered` → `int`
   - `Price Each` → `float`
4. Extracted new columns:
   - `Month` and `Hour` from `Order Date`
   - `City` from `Purchase Address`
5. Calculated additional columns:
   - `Sales = Quantity Ordered * Price Each`
